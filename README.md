mindplay/heyloyalty
-------------------

Basic client for the [Hey Loyalty API](https://api.heyloyalty.com/docs/introduction).

This is not intended to be a full or complete API client - it currently implements
enumeration and loading of lists and members, both mapped to model objects, and all
possible operations on members. It does not implement creating/deleting/editing lists.

The test-suite is dependent on a particular list structure and member content created
under our account, so it can currently only be run by us. It passes, but you'll have
to take our word for it.
